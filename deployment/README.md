## Running `all_runtime.py`
If you want to compare mixed and homogeneous workloads with `all_runtime.py` you may add a picture which is used by the file API (we tested with a 1.6KB file).

Additionally, install [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) in the same folder as `all_runtime.py`.

Create `./tmp/images/` and add an example image: `cd /tmp/images && wget https://cdn.tsicons.com/icons/LYO6Xq3RZ3gy.png`

With this prerequisites you are able to run `all_runtime.py` directly.

Otherwise, please modify the script to use an image of your preference.
